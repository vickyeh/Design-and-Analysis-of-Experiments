## Design and Analysis of Experiments

It is a class from the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. 
This course focuses on design of experiments, covering essential concepts such as randomization, blocking, and confounding. 
We also learn how to analyze experimental data using R, applying techniques like randomization tests, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance to gain insights from our data.
